# IST412_FinanceApp
The ATZ Finance Application is a loan finance application where individuals can apply for a variety of loans over a any amount of time. It requires the customer information, information about their employer, and provides loan information for the user to select the appropriate loan. The application will ultimatelly have full functionality where you can see both the employee and customer side of the loan application process.

In the current update we created a user dashboard button that way they can see their options clearly and start to get some feedback as previously discussed. We also updated a loan application form, the customer dashboard controller, and the contorller for the loan application form. In addition many edits were resolved from the previous design issues.
